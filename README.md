# Ames-Housing-Analysis 
by Hayden Warren, Julie Hemily, Alex Austin & Niki Agrawal 

Our client is a startup real estate company that has asked us to build a rival to housing price estimates such as Zillow's Zestimate. The client has asked us to focus on accuracy over interpretation, however, feature importance information is gladly received.   

Our goal:  Predict housing price with the highest R2 value for homes in the city of Ames located in Story County, Iowa
Zillow employs a neural network-based model
There are Zestimates for  29,800 off-market homes in Story County
Here, we explore less computationally expensive and complex models to accurately estimate home prices in Ames 

Our coding process: The four of us contributed various notebooks and scripts and added them to our individual dev folders. The final version of the code used to create the final results is located in the 'Final' folder. 

**Final Folder Contents**:
1. helper.py : contains many helper functions related to data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering. 
2. Individual models: files like ElasticNet.ipynb, lasso_final.ipynb, rf_final.ipynb contain coding for different ML models tested in this project.
